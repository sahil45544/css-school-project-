        <H2> <I> <U> <Q> Education is an essential part of our lives. We are nothing without knowledge, and education is what separates us from others. The main step to acquiring education is enrolling oneself in a school. School serves as the first learning place for most of the people. Similarly, it is the first spark in receiving an education. In this essay on my school, I will tell you why I love my school and what my school has taught me.</Q></U></I></H2>

                    <H2 class="l5"> <I> <U> This technique allows students to participate in the learning process, not only do students understand the concept-based knowledge but also they can develop crucial skills which play a vital in the modern world.</U></I></H2>

                            <H2 class="l6"> <I> <U> Design-Based Learning (DBL) was inspired by the progressive educational system of the early 20th century, which primarily emphasizes experimental learning. Prominent educators such as John Dewey promoted learning by doing. The current version of DBL has been greatly impacted by the development of technology and a deeper comprehension of cognitive science, which validates the efficacy of inquiry-based, hands-on learning.</U></I></H2>

<h1 class="l3"> <b> <u> <q> >>>>>CO-OPREATIVE LEARINING:-<<<<<</q></u></b></h1>
<H2 class="l7"> <I> <U> Cooperative Learning is a type of method that emphasises on student cooperation and teamwork. Sometimes studying on its own isn’t enough to provide the intended outcomes. Under this method, students are encouraged to study in small group to achieve their common academic goals. It is highly recommended for the free flow of ideas, opinions and knowledge among them. It also enhances their learning areas and outcomes.</U></I></H2>

        <H2 class="l8"> <I> <U> Gamification in education is the use of game dynamics, mechanics, and components in the classroom to increase student motivation and learning outcomes. Utilising the games’ inherent appeal, this method engages students and promotes their active participation in a range of educational activities.</U></I></H2>
